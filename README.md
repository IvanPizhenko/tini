# TinyINI

TinyINI is small and simple open-source library for loading, saving and managing INI file data structures in the memory. TinyINI library relies on the open-source **IniH** library (https://github.com/benhoyt/inih) for parsing text of INI file. Source code of INIH library and information about it, including licensing conditions, is included in the subfolder inih. Default makefile, supplied with TinyINI library compiles both IniH and TinyINI code into single static library file.

TinyINI is distibuted under 3-clause "new BSD" license, which allows modifications and commercial use. Find more details here: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause and in the bundled file *LICENSE.txt*.

Hoping that my small library will be useful you.
