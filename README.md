# TinyINI

TinyINI is a small and simple library for loading, saving and managing INI file data in the memory. TinyINI library relies on the open-source **IniH** library (https://github.com/benhoyt/inih) for parsing contents of the INI files. Source code of the INIH library and information about it, including licensing conditions, is included in the subfolder inih. Default makefile, supplied with the TinyINI library compiles both IniH and TinyINI code into the single static library file.

TinyINI is licensed under the 3-clause "new BSD" license, which allows modifications and commercial use. You can find more details here: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause and in the bundled file *LICENSE.txt*.

I'm hoping this small library will be useful for you.
